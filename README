#Adapt language matcher

This script is designed to take two or more adapt 2 courses built in the authoring tool and align the IDs of both so they can be multi-language and tracked the same. 

For this to work both courses MUST be exactly the same structure!

##How to use

1. Download the two (or more) courses from the authoring tool (download, not source code)

2. Create a "build" folder for each language in this directory (e.g. en and uk)

3. Save "web page (complete)" in Google chrome for the menu (menu.html) and each module (modX.html) in both languages in the build folders

4. Remove the "files" folders that save as a result of step 3.

5. Run "php match_ids.php <source_ids_lang> <destination_ids_lang>"

6. Download a new copy of the source_ids course language into a new folder

7. Copy the target language from the destination folder from step 5 into the course folder of the course from step 6.
